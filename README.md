# FRepCAM
Computer-aided Manufacturing system for Function Represented models.

This project is CAM system for Function Representation approach in 3D modeling.  Function Representation (FRep) is geometric representation in an implicit form, where the object is represented by a mathematical function. This method has a significant potential for the area of Additive Manufacturing. 

The opensource project [hyperfun.org] is devoted to the Function Representation.

FRepCAM system was implemented using c++17 programming language and Qt framework.

FRepCAM software modules are available on request.
